# 🚀 Complete Setup Guide

Your Beyblade Tracker is now a full-featured web application with user authentication! Here's how to get it running:

## Phase 1: Database Setup

## Step 1: Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Click "New Project"
4. Choose your organization
5. Fill in project details:
   - Name: `beyblade-tracker`
   - Database Password: (choose a strong password)
   - Region: (choose closest to you)
6. Wait for project to be created (~2 minutes)

## Step 2: Get Your Project Credentials

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Settings** → **API**
2. Copy your **Project URL** and **anon public key**

## Step 3: Update Environment Variables

Replace the placeholders in `.env.local` with your actual credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

## Step 4: Set Up Database Schema

1. In Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Copy the contents of `supabase-schema.sql` from your project
3. Paste and run the SQL commands
4. This will create your `beyblade_parts` table with sample data

## Step 5: Test Your App

1. Save your `.env.local` file
2. Your development server should automatically restart
3. Navigate to `/collection` in your browser
4. You should see:
   - Collection statistics showing your sample parts
   - A form to add new parts
   - A list of existing parts
